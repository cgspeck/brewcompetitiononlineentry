<!--
SOME THINGS TO NOTE:
- DO NOT include <html> or <body> tags!!
- All files MUST have a .php extension (e.g., name_of_file.php - some servers running PHP are not configured to include files with other exensions).
- For the program to use any custom module, its information MUST be added into the database.
  -- The Custom Modules option must be enabled via Website Preferences
  -- The EXACT filename and other info (position, rank, description) must be entered into the database via the Add Custom Modules screen
- The corresponding file should be uploaded to the "mods" sub-folder via secure FTP.
- Custom modules can only be placed above content (just below the main navigation) or below content (just above the footer).
- You can have multiple custom modules. They will be displayed in the rank order you choose.
